recipeinstructions:
- "Ingredients ready? Let’s go!"
- "First off cut your florets into bite size pieces and put in a frying pan on low heat with 3 sprays of low cal garlic oil. Keep an eye on them as you don’t want them burnt just slightly charred."
- "Whilst your broccoli is gently cooking, remove the sinew from your chicken and slice into small pieces and do the same with your bacon. Put this to the side and check on your broccoli."
- "Your broccoli should now look slightly charred like this and soft but not squishy mush! Now put in your chicken and brown off before adding the bacon and tsb of garlic paste. Cook slowly occasionall tossing (stiring if your clumsy like me)"
- "Fill a pan with boiling water and add 2 good size handfuls of pasta and bring to the boil. The fresh stuff only takes 4 minutes!"
- "Whilst this is happening take a jug and separate the yolks from two eggs and put into the jug. Gently whisk and add in parmesan or just use the dried Italian style cheese that comes in a plastic tub. It works just as well! That’s what I use :). Mix all together and season!"
- "The pasta should now be done. Before you drain it completely set some of the water the pasta has been cooking In aside. Add the drained pasta to the chicken and bacon mix and mix together. Add a splash of the pasta water and then stir the egg mixture in with the pasta. (I think The idea of the water is that it will stop the egg from scrambling)"
- "Make sure all of the pasta is coated with the sauce and serve! Yum!!"
