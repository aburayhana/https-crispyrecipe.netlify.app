I totally agree that homemade Indian cooking is very different from the restaurant‚Ä¶much more simple, low cal and delicious! In this mild Northern Indian dish, chicken is simmered in a creamy fragrant sauce with onion, garlic, ginger and cashews. Serve over basmati or sticky rice. This dish was as good as any chicken Korma I have had in an Indian restaurant.

Serve over basmati or sticky rice. This dish was as good as any chicken Korma I have had in an Indian restaurant. Two things to note, I used fat free coconut milk in place of half and. Curries are so different and yet somehow they are all so comforting. The classic chicken korma recipe includes onions, garlic and ginger but red bell peppers, carrots or potatoes would work Qorma is a mughlai dish that has a very specific list of ingredients and spices‚Ä¶ Chicken shahi korma recipe, shahi murgh, Shahi Mughlai Chicken Korma, Indian chicken korma.
