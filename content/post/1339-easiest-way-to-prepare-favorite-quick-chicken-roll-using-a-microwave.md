- "1 Plastic wrap"
- "1 whatever is available Juice leftover from cooking the chicken"
- "3 tbsp Sake"
- "2 tbsp Mirin"
- "2 tbsp Soy sauce"

recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the carrots the same thickness as the green beans.  Butterfly the chicken thighs in thick places to even out the thickness overall."
- "Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.  Lay out the carrots and green beans, and wrap the meat into a roll around them.  Wrap the roll with plastic wrap."
- "Make sure one end of the plastic wrap is loose so that air can go through.  This will stop the wrap from bursting during cooking."

Combine the chicken juices, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar in a frying pan and mix them together while heating."
