- "Smash the avocado with a fork. Add the oil sauce and mix to create an avocado sauce. Cut the sinew from the chicken tenderloin, and cut it into small cubes before adding it to the avocado sauce.  Avocado doesn&#39;t change colour when heated, so there is no need to add an acid to prevent colour change."

Put this into a preheated oven at 480째F/250째C for 10-15 minutes. When the chicken is thoroughly cooked and the cheese has melted and turned golden brown, the doria is finished.  If you cook this in a toaster oven, cover with foil to keep the top from burning."
