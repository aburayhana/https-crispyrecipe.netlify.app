recipeingredient:
- " Crust"
- "1 cup milk"
- "1 tbsp baking powder"
- "2 cup flour"
- "1/3 cup canola oil"
- "1 tsp salt"
- " Filling"
- "1 lb chicken breasts chopped into bite size pieces"
- "1 packages frozen mixed vegetables"
- "2 tbsp Mrs Dash Garlic and Herbs"
- " sea salt"
- " ground black pepper"
- "6 tbsp flour"
- "1 tbsp canola oil"
- "4 cup milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425°F."
- "Combine flour, salt and flour in mixing bowl. Add in oil and milk. Mix thoroughly, then set aside."
- "Heat oil in a deep frying pan at medium-high heat. Add chicken, cook until chicken is no longer pink."
- "Add flour one tablespoon at a time, mixing so that it thoroughly coats the  chicken and absorbs the oil. Also add seasoning at this time."
- "Add milk slowly, mixing thoroughly as you do. It should start thickening into gravy as it mixes with the floured chicken."
- "Add vegetables to the  chicken gravy. Allow gravy to cook until vegetables defrost, stirring frequently."
- "In your baking dish, take about half of the dough you made previously and press it evenly into the bottom of the dish. Bake in oven for 5-10 minutes, or until the crust just starts to turn brown (I usually do this while I&#39;m preparing the filling) Remove from oven."
- "Scoop/pour the filling into the baking dish on top of the crust."
- "Flatten the remaining dough out evenly and lay it over the filling so that it covers it (It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect, as the crust usually pulls away from the edges a bit anyway)."
- "Place in oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is a golden brown."
- "Remove from oven and serve! If you allow it to sit and cool for a few minutes before serving, its usually a little easier to scoop out, as the filling thickens a little as it cools. Enjoy!"
