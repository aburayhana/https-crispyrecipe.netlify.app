- "8 oz mild shredded cheddar cheese"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a suitable storage container(I prefer glass) place chicken and 1/4-3/8 cup key lime juice and approx. 1/2 tbsp. salt.  Refrigerate overnight."
- "Remove chicken from refrigerator.  Melt butter in skillet over low heat.  Add remaining salt and distribute evenly in pan.  Add chicken and discard liquid from storage container."
- "Increase heat to high and char outside of chicken.  Actually burn it a little.  Add remaining lime juice a bit at a time.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked throughout(Maybe 20 minutes?)"
- "Remove chicken from heat and cool completely.  Once cooled pull chicken or cut into 1/4 inch cubes."
- "Get separate larger skillet and place tortilla in this.  Add small amount of chicken(if you add too much your tortilla will fall apart). Add cheese to taste(I like a lot; this melts so that&#39;s okay).  Heat over low heat until tortilla starts to feel firm.  Fold over and continue cooking until both sides have crisped(I like mine slightly burnt) and cheese is melted.  Enjoy!"
