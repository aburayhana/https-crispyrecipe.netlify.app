recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the 8 strips of bacon in half. Cook bacon in skillet(your bacon of choice, I used turkey bacon). I cook my bacon with a lil crunch to it. If you use turkey bacon, I recommend putting a little vegetable oil in the bottom of the skillet, to prevent sticking, because turkey bacon doesn&#39;t produce a lot of grease."
- "Take out the bacon after it&#39;s done cooking and set aside."
- "I turn off the stove as I&#39;m preparing each quesadilla in the skillet, to prevent any burning. Because sometimes I&#39;m a little slow at preparing things, and I like to take my time. I turn the stove back on, when I&#39;m done preparing the quesadilla and it is ready to be cooked."
- "Add the flour tortilla to the skillet, with just enough oil to fry it."
- "Add the bacon(4 slices), fajita chicken, hidden valley ranch, and fiesta cheese blend to the tortilla."
- ""

- "With your spatula, fold the tortilla in half with everything in it. I hold the spatula on top of it, until the tortilla stays folded in half, then I flip it."
- "I flip it probably 3 times before I take it out. Flip occasionally to prevent burning. Take out when slightly golden brown and all cheese is melted. Serve and enjoy."
